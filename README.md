# eliteschedule
Ionic mobile app to follow NFL leagues and teams

What We'll Be Building
A few minutes ago you already saw a preview of the app we'll be building during this course. 
I want to also show you what it's based on. In this scenario we already have an existing website, elite-schedule.net. 
The website already enables the functionality we're looking for, but we will essentially be building a mobile optimized app 
for this site. Here we have the Home page for Elite Schedule. I can click here and get the full schedule for the entire league 
or tournament. I can see a Standings screen. We can see the different divisions here. We can click on any one of these teams 
and see the team schedule. We can click to another team and see their team schedule. We can see the scores along the right side.
We can see the standings, win/loss percentage, points for, points against. We can see the locations. We can click here for directions
and get maps. We can see the rules. And we can also switch leagues. So this is the website that is already preexisting, and 
throughout the course we're going to build a mobile app that's going to allow coaches and parents of players to more easily see
the schedules for their teams.
